# E-Attendance-System-based-on-YOLOv3-Darknet-Model
E-Attendance System is based on recognizing the presence of the students using Facial Recognition and then maintaining the records of the students' attendance on MySQL Database. So, the core idea behind our problem is **Object Detection**. Here, objects are the faces of the students whom attendance is to be marked as "Present".
## Our Setup



## Core Idea
**Object Detection = Object Localisation + Object Recognition (Object Classification)**
