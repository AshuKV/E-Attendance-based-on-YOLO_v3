# E-Attendance-System-based-on-YOLOv3-Darknet-Model
E-Attendance System is based on recognizing the presence of the students using Facial Recognition and then maintaining the records of the students' attendance on MySQL Database. So, the core idea of our problem is **Object Detection**.
**Object Detection = Object Localisation + Object Recognition(Object Classification)**
